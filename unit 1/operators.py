#operator are a construct (built-in system) that give
#p
#data types more actions and power.
# Arithmetic operator family 
# arithmetic operators are simply math operations
print(2+4) #additon operater
print(10-10) #subtraction operator
print(2/1) #divison operator 
print (20.9 * 12.34) # multiplication operator

#Assignment operator family
# these operators assign values to
# variables (otherwise know as containers)
# key/value pairs

schoolname= ''boys latin''
age += 2 # adding a new value to our variable 
age *= 3 #multiplying a new value to our variable 

print(''123abc== 123avbc)# double equal signs mean
#its comparing if the values are the same 

#logical operator family
# it checks and compares if certain code condititions 
#are true or false
print(3 1 and vonte == vonte) # this will return true
#the and operator checks to see one of the condition are 
#if both are true the answer is true

print (2==1 or 3 2)# this will return true
# the or operator checks if one of the conditions is true
#so long as
